		<p id="sub-heading-paragraph">At over 40 years, the Landsat series of satellites provides the longest temporal record of moderate resolution multispectral data of the Earth’s surface on a global basis. The Landsat record has remained remarkably unbroken, proving a unique resource to assist a broad range of specialists in managing the world’s food, water, forests, and other natural resources for a growing world population.  It is a record unmatched in quality, detail, coverage, and value.</p>

				<h2>Landsat Project Description</h2>
				<p>Landsat represents the world's longest continuously acquired collection of space-based moderate-resolution land remote sensing data. Four decades of imagery provides a unique resource for those who work in agriculture, geology, forestry, regional planning, education, mapping, and global change research. </p>
				<p>Landsat images are also invaluable for emergency response and disaster relief. As a joint initiative between the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and NASA, the Landsat Project and the data it collects support government, commercial, industrial, civilian, military, and educational communities throughout the United States and worldwide.</p>
				<p>On May 30, 2013, data from the Landsat 8 satellite (launched as the Landsat Data Continuity Mission - LDCM- on February 11, 2013) became available. As with previous partnerships, this mission continues the acquisition of high-quality data that meet both NASA and USGS scientific and operational requirements for observing land use and land change.</p>

		      <h2>Landsat Global Archive Consolidation (LGAC)</h2>
		      <p>Landsat satellites have acquired data from across the globe for more than four decades. The National Satellite Land Remote Sensing Data Archive at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center holds the single most geographically and temporally rich collection of Landsat data in the world, currently holding more than six million Landsat scenes.</p>
