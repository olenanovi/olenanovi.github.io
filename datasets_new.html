				<h2>Landsat</h2>
				<p>Landsat, a joint program of the USGS and NASA, has been observing the Earth continuously from 1972 through the present day. Today the Landsat satellites image the entire Earth's surface at a 30-meter resolution about once every two weeks, including multispectral and thermal data. Earth Engine makes this data available in its raw form, as TOA-corrected reflectance, and in various ready-to-use computed products such as NDVI and EVI vegetation indices.</p>

		      <p>Indian coffee, grown mostly in southern India under monsoon rainfall conditions, is also termed as âIndian monsooned coffee". Its flavor is defined as: "At its best similar to the flavor characteristics of Pacific coffees, but at its worst bland and uninspiringâ. The two well known species of coffee grown are the Arabica and Robusta. Probably the most commonly planted Arabica in India and Southeast Asia is S.795.</p>
